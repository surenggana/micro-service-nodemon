# Phase 11 — Monolith Route Parity (Option A: full backend implementation)

Goal: make every route the monolith (`../nodemon/public/assets/app.js`) calls work against the microservice stack. The BFF aliases already exist; the downstream controllers now implement the tracked route areas.

## Route audit

| Frontend call | BFF alias | Downstream | Status |

| `/api/sessions*`, `/api/mikrotik/:id/connect/test` | sessions/mikrotik | erp RouterSessionController | ✅ done |
| `/api/voucher-types*` | voucher-types | erp `/voucher/types*` | ✅ done |
| `/api/batches/*` | batches | erp `/voucher/batches*` | ✅ done |
| `/api/voucher/:cs/profiles` | voucher | erp `/voucher/batches/:cs/import/profiles` | ✅ done |

| `POST /api/session/router`, `GET /api/session/active` | BFF-local SessionController | main-node-service session | ✅ done |

## Implementation notes

### Session state
`POST /api/session/router` and `GET /api/session/active` are intentionally BFF-local because the active router is stored in the cookie session.

### ERP router operations
Hotspot, PPPoE, reporting, voucher generation, scheduler, DHCP, interfaces, system-resource, and related routes use the existing Go RouterService / report gRPC contracts.

### Billing
Billing entities and service cover customer CRUD, invoice generation/manual creation/payment/reminders, overdue suspension/re-enable, settlements, collector summaries, and router-user import. `GET /api/billing/:cs/import-users/:type` now reads the selected router's Hotspot users or PPPoE secrets over RouterService gRPC and upserts them into billing customers, preserving existing customer metadata while refreshing MikroTik identity/profile/status.

### Payments
The payments admin surface is backed by QRIS voucher orders and payment configuration, with list/stats/config/test/detail/check endpoints exposed through the BFF.

## Verification state
- Route parity implementation is present for the previously tracked TODO areas.
- Full live deployment verification is still environment-dependent; see `TODO-PHASE12.md` for the final data-restore verification step.

## Build + E2E
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
GATEWAY_PORT=80 ./scripts/verify-e2e.sh
```

The final data restore verification remains environment-dependent and requires the actual source `mikhmon.db` and target PostgreSQL instance.

## Notes
- Follow existing patterns: JwtAuthGuard + RequirePermission on controllers.
- BFF canonical path mapping must match downstream controllers.
- Go proto regeneration is required whenever the shared RouterService contract changes.
